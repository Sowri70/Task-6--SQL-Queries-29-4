Database File :   Onlinesalesdata

Table:            Onlinesales

Have made an attempt to work on queries based on 

    1.  Aggregations (SUM, AVERAGE, COUNT)

    2.  GROUP BY used for Product_Category and Product_Name total sales 

    3.  ORDER BY used for sorting in descending order.  

    4.  Partition and Rank were used for identifying Top 10 products saleswise

    5.  Extracting MonthName from Date column and sort by month (could not do by year, as the data was only for less than a year)

    6.  DISTINCT is used for counting products and category and to avoid duplicates.
